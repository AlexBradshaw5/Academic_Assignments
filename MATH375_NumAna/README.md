# Math 375 Numerical Analysis
In real world applied math and engineering, it’s often not possible to write down formulas
for the solutions to math problems that we encounter. In such cases, a common approach is
to compute an approximate solution, with the assistance of computers to perform calculations
for us. We will learn to do this for the following types of problems: computing derivatives
and integrals, solving systems of linear equations, solving systems of nonlinear equations,
and solving optimization problems. If time allows, we might also learn about computing
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and solving differential equations. Throughout the course we
will implement numerical algorithms in Python.

## Student Learning Outcomes

In this course students will learn to:
Numerically compute derivatives using first and second-order finite difference approximations;
Numerically approximate integrals using the midpoint method, trapezoidal method,
and Simpson’s method;
Solve smooth unconstrained optimization problems using gradient descent, stochastic
gradient descent, and Newton’s method. This includes learning what the gradient is
and how to compute it using some techniques from vector calculus.
Numerically solve linear systems of equations using LU factorization, QR factorization,
and iterative methods such as the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods and the conjugate
gradient method.
We will implement algorithms from scratch in Python. If time allows, we will also learn to
solve ordinary differential equations using Euler’s method, the backward Euler method, and
Runge-Kutte methods. Additional topics, as time allows, include numerically computing
eigenvectors using the QR method
