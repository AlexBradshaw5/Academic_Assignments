# CS 245 Data Structures and Algorithms (Undergrad)
Algorithm analysis and asymptotic running time calculations. Algorithm design techniques and implementation details. Algorithms for sorting and searching, trees, graphs, and other selected topics. This course partially covers the "Theory" and "Application" Program Learning Outcomes. Students who complete this course will be able to explain and analyze standard computer science algorithms, specifically:
Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms, including:
Array sorting algorithms (Insertion sort, Quicksort, Merge sort, etc.)
Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, etc.)
Explain and implement the algorithms associated with the following data structures:
Stacks, Queues, Lists,
Binary Search Trees,
Heaps,
Hash Tables.
Apply an understanding of algorithms and data structures to writing medium-scale programs in Java:
Build many common data structures
Compare and contrast different data structures and algorithms.

# Math 375 Numerical Analysis
In real world applied math and engineering, itâ€™s often not possible to write down formulas
for the solutions to math problems that we encounter. In such cases, a common approach is
to compute an approximate solution, with the assistance of computers to perform calculations
for us. We will learn to do this for the following types of problems: computing derivatives
and integrals, solving systems of linear equations, solving systems of nonlinear equations,
and solving optimization problems. If time allows, we might also learn about computing
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and solving differential equations. Throughout the course we
will implement numerical algorithms in Python.

# MSDS 604 Time Series Analysis
This course is an intensive introduction to the theory and methods of time series models. The

broad introduction of more advanced methods for time series. The primary language used in
this course will be Python.

# MSDS 629 Data Structures and Algorithms (Grad)
The goal is to give students a deeper and more general view of data structures and algorithms. While students have examined a number of data structures, such as binary trees, already, this course provides a much more in-depth study. This depth will benefit them greatly in the advanced machine learning course. This course also tends to address many of the difficult algorithm questions students get during job interviews. The critical data structures covered in this class are: lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and tries. The course also covers a variety of common and useful recursive and non-recursive algorithms, such as searching and sorting.

# MSDS 630 Advanced Machine Learning
On completion of this course the student should be able to:
Describe and apply several learning algorithms/ models and their variants, including:
Principal Component Analysis, Collaborative Filtering, Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Select the appropriate learning algorithm or approach for a given situation or dataset.
Implement from scratch various machine learning algorithms in Python like Gradient Boosting
and Matrix Factorization.
Implement basic Neural Networks in PyTorch.
Implement advanced feature engineering techniques.
As part of a team, carry out a machine learning project from start to end, including:
Research literature related to the problem.
Prepare the data for application of algorithms, including feature engineering.
Choose and apply the appropriate ML algorithms (as well as hyper-parameter tuning).
Evaluate the results.
Communicate the results both orally and in writing.

# MSDS 633 Data Ethics
This course aims to provide students with some basic concepts around data ethics. It will likely leave you with more questions than answers, but I hope to provide some sense of how ethics play a role in the technologies that surround us. From social media creating political and ideological bubbles, to law enforcement using flawed algorithms, to online privacy and surveillance, we will explore how we can put an ethical lense on the digital world that has been integrated into our daily lives.

# MSDS 692 Data Acquisition
The title of this course is "Data Acquisition" but of course, once we get the data, we have to organize it into handy data structures and typically have to extract information from the raw data. For example, we might need to boil down a Twitter stream into a single positive or negative sentiment score for a given user. This course teaches you how to collect, organize, coalesce, and extract information from multiple sources in preparation for your analysis work. Along the way, you'll learn about the commandline, git, networks, the internet protocols, and building your own web servers.
