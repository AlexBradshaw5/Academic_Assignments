# CS 245
Algorithm analysis and asymptotic running time calculations. Algorithm design techniques and implementation details. Algorithms for sorting and searching, trees, graphs, and other selected topics. This course partially covers the "Theory" and "Application" Program Learning Outcomes. Students who complete this course will be able to explain and analyze standard computer science algorithms, specifically:
Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms, including:
Array sorting algorithms (Insertion sort, Quicksort, Merge sort, etc.)
Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, etc.)
Explain and implement the algorithms associated with the following data structures:
Stacks, Queues, Lists,
Binary Search Trees,
Heaps,
Hash Tables.
Apply an understanding of algorithms and data structures to writing medium-scale programs in Java:
Build many common data structures
Compare and contrast different data structures and algorithms
# MSDS 629 Data Structures and Algorithms (Grad)
The goal is to give students a deeper and more general view of data structures and algorithms. While students have examined a number of data structures, such as binary trees, already, this course provides a much more in-depth study. This depth will benefit them greatly in the advanced machine learning course. This course also tends to address many of the difficult algorithm questions students get during job interviews. The critical data structures covered in this class are: lists, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, and tries. The course also covers a variety of common and useful recursive and non-recursive algorithms, such as searching and sorting.
# MSDS 633 Data Ethics
This course aims to provide students with some basic concepts around data ethics. It will likely leave you with more questions than answers, but I hope to provide some sense of how ethics play a role in the technologies that surround us. From social media creating political and ideological bubbles, to law enforcement using flawed algorithms, to online privacy and surveillance, we will explore how we can put an ethical lense on the digital world that has been integrated into our daily lives.
